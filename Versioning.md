# Versioning 
Software releases will be verisoned along with the hardware. All software releases therefore will start with hardware release number, software release number, revision number, and meet/competion number if applicable

Examples of this 

* v1 of robot, first software release at meet 1
```v1.1.0-meet.1```

* v2 of robot, 10th software release but without meet (wasnt at meet or used at meet yet) and was the 3rd revision of the software.
```v2.10.3```
